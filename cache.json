Since signed languages exhibit all the fundamental\nlinguistic properties of natural language, we believe that tools and theories\nof Natural Language Processing (NLP) are crucial towards its modeling. However,\nexisting research in Sign Language Processing (SLP) seldom attempt to explore\nand leverage the linguistic organization of signed languages. This position\npaper calls on the NLP community to include signed languages as a research area\nwith high social and scientific impact. We first discuss the linguistic\nproperties of signed languages to consider during their modeling. Then, we\nreview the limitations of current SLP models and identify the open challenges\nto extend NLP to signed languages. Finally, we urge (1) the adoption of an\nefficient tokenization method; (2) the development of linguistically-informed\nmodels; (3) the collection of real-world signed language data; (4) the\ninclusion of local signed language communities as an active and leading voice\nin the direction of research.",
