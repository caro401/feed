          "description": "Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source\n\nAggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>\nVideos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed\nAds are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃\nWorks on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.\nCaveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

          "description": "Hello! I’m very slowly\nworking on writing a zine about debugging, so I asked on Twitter the other day:\nIf you’ve run into a bug where it felt “impossible” to understand what was happening – what made it feel that way?\nOf course, bugs always happen for logical reasons, but I’ve definitely run into\nbugs that felt like they might be impossible for me to understand (until I\nfigured them out!)\nI got about 400 responses, which I’ll try to summarize here. I’m not going to\ntalk about how to deal with these various kinds of “impossible” bugs in this\npost, I’ll just try to classify them.\nHere are the categories I came up with for ways a bug might feel impossible\nto understand.
