          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

I’m very slowly\nworking on writing a zine about debugging, so I asked on Twitter the other day:\nIf you’ve run into a bug where it felt “impossible” to understand what was happening – what made it feel that way?\nOf course, bugs always happen for logical reasons, but I’ve definitely run into\nbugs that felt like they might be impossible for me to understand (until I\nfigured them out!)\nI got about 400 responses, which I’ll try to summarize here. I’m not going to\ntalk about how to deal with these various kinds of “impossible” bugs in this\npost, I’ll just try to classify them.\nHere are the categories I came up with for ways a bug might feel impossible\nto understand. Each one of them has a bunch of sub variants which are bolded below.\nit’s hard to reproduce\nyou don’t understand the overall…",

To start I’ve printed 350 copies of each of the “Bite\nSize…” zines.\nHere’s a photo of the front of the zines and some stickers:\nand the back covers:\n\n\n\nHere are some notes about how the store works:\ngreat print quality!\nI worked with a really good print company (Girlie Press) and printed the zines on some nice paper,\nso they look WAY nicer than they do when printed on a home printer :). I’m\ndelighted with how they turned out.\nWhen I originally started working on this project I thought about using a\nprint-on-demand company briefly (it sounds so convenient!) but I ordered test\nprints from all the ones I could find and it turns out that none of them could\nproduce the print qualit…",

One barrier that stood out to me was: it’s hard to identify\nwhich things you know will be useful to other people!\nThe process I use for a lot of my blog posts is:\nStruggle with something (usually computer-related)\nEventually (days or months or years later), figure out how to solve some of\nthe problems I had\nWrite a blog post about what helped me\nI think this approach is effective because if I struggled with something,\nthere’s a pretty good chance that other people are struggling with it too, and\nwhat I learned is likely to be useful to at least some of them!\nObviously this isn’t the only approach to blogging, but it’s my approach, so\nthat’s what I’m going to write about here :).
