When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "TCP/IP is the set of networking protocols that we use on the modern internet –\nTCP, UDP, IP, ARP, ICMP, DNS, etc. When I talk about “networking”, I’m\nbasically always talking about TCP/IP.\nMany explanations of TCP/IP start with something called the “OSI model”. I\ndon’t use the OSI model when explaining networking because when I first\nstarted learning about internet networking I found all of the OSI model\nexplanations really confusing – it wasn’t clear to me at all how the OSI\nmodel corresponded to TCP/IP.\nSo if you’re just starting to learn about networking and you’re confused about\nthe OSI model, here’s an explanation of how it corresponds to TCP/IP, how\nit doesn’t, and why it’s safe to mostly just ignore it if you don’t find it helpful.\nthe OSI model has 7 layers\nLet’s very briefly discu…",

As you probably know, I write a lot of comics about programming, and I publish collections of them as zines you can buy at https://wizardzines.com.\nI also usually post the comics on Twitter as I write them. But there are a lot of problems with just posting them to Twitter, like:\nthe pages are hard to find. For example, if you want to find the one on\nsocat, you can search twitter\nand you’ll find it, but then you have to somehow magically guess what words I\nused in the tweet, and also sort through a bunch of other tweets.\nthey’re annoying to link to. Twitter isn’t really the best user interface for this sort of thing.\nI can’t make updates. Twitter doesn’t have an edit button!\nwork that never made it into a zine is basically impossible to find.
