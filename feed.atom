        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I’m very slowly
working on writing a zine about debugging, so I asked on Twitter the other day:
If you’ve run into a bug where it felt “impossible” to understand what was happening – what made it feel that way?
Of course, bugs always happen for logical reasons, but I’ve definitely run into
bugs that felt like they might be impossible for me to understand (until I
figured them out!)
I got about 400 responses, which I’ll try to summarize here. I’m not going to
talk about how to deal with these various kinds of “impossible” bugs in this
post, I’ll just try to classify them.
Here are the categories I came up with for ways a bug might feel impossible
to understand. Each one of them has a bunch of sub variants which are bolded below.

store last week, so now you can buy print
copies of my zines! To start I’ve printed 350 copies of each of the “Bite
Size…” zines.
Here’s a photo of the front of the zines and some stickers:
and the back covers:



Here are some notes about how the store works:
great print quality!
I worked with a really good print company (Girlie Press) and printed the zines on some nice paper,
so they look WAY nicer than they do when printed on a home printer :). I’m
delighted with how they turned out.
When I originally started working on this project I thought about using a
print-on-demand company briefly (it sounds so convenient!) but I ordered test
prints from all the ones I could find and it turns out that none of them could
produce the print qualit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

from blogging. One barrier that stood out to me was: it’s hard to identify
which things you know will be useful to other people!
The process I use for a lot of my blog posts is:
Struggle with something (usually computer-related)
Eventually (days or months or years later), figure out how to solve some of
the problems I had
Write a blog post about what helped me
I think this approach is effective because if I struggled with something,
there’s a pretty good chance that other people are struggling with it too, and
what I learned is likely to be useful to at least some of them!
Obviously this isn’t the only approach to blogging, but it’s my approach, so
that’s what I’m going to write about here :). I’ll give a few examples of
