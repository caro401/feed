                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.

understand exactly how the stack works or how to look at it.
So here’s a quick walkthrough of how you can use gdb to look at the stack of a C
program. I think this would be similar for a Rust program, but I’m going to use
C because I find it a little simpler for a toy example and also you can do Terrible
Things in C more easily.
our test program
Here’s a simple C program that declares a few variables and reads two strings
from standard input. One of the strings is on the heap, and one is on the
stack.
#include 
#include 

int main() {
    char stack_string[10] &#x3D; &quot;stack&quot;;
    int x &#x3D; 10;

                    <span>TCP/IP is the set of networking protocols that we use on the modern internet –
TCP, UDP, IP, ARP, ICMP, DNS, etc. When I talk about “networking”, I’m
basically always talking about TCP/IP.
Many explanations of TCP/IP start with something called the “OSI model”. I
don’t use the OSI model when explaining networking because when I first
started learning about internet networking I found all of the OSI model
explanations really confusing – it wasn’t clear to me at all how the OSI
model corresponded to TCP/IP.
So if you’re just starting to learn about networking and you’re confused about
the OSI model, here’s an explanation of how it corresponds to TCP/IP, how
it doesn’t, and why it’s safe to mostly just ignore it if you don’t find it helpful.
the OSI model has 7 layers

                    <span>Hello! As you probably know, I write a lot of comics about programming, and I publish collections of them as zines you can buy at https://wizardzines.com.
I also usually post the comics on Twitter as I write them. But there are a lot of problems with just posting them to Twitter, like:
the pages are hard to find. For example, if you want to find the one on
socat, you can search twitter
and you’ll find it, but then you have to somehow magically guess what words I
used in the tweet, and also sort through a bunch of other tweets.
they’re annoying to link to. Twitter isn’t really the best user interface for this sort of thing.
I can’t make updates. Twitter doesn’t have an edit button!
work that never made it into a zine is basically impossible to find. For example I
wrote 12 pages of a sequel …</span>
